//! One reading of song titles and artist credits for every place Octo decides whether two
//! songs are the same.
//!
//! Text arguments are `&str`, where a missing value is passed as `""` and reads as empty. An
//! `Option` is kept only where missing means something else: the artist of
//! [`SongIdentity::parse_title`], where `None` reads the title alone and empty means the song
//! has no artist.
//!
//! Regex notes. The `regex` crate has no lookaround, so the four patterns that need it are
//! matched in two steps that give the same answer: the track-number lookahead is a captured
//! character, the `x` separator's negative lookahead is checked after the match (and the search
//! resumes one character on, as a backtracking engine would), and the `VEVO` lookbehind is
//! tested by hand. Leftmost-first alternation and lazy quantifiers behave as in a backtracking
//! engine. Where the Unicode classes must answer differently from Rust's, the pattern is run over
//! a same-length view of the text: [`word_boundary_view`] for `\b` (word characters here are
//! letters, nonspacing marks, digits and connectors in one UTF-16 unit; Rust's also take spacing
//! marks and supplementary letters), [`utf16_class_view`] for `\d` and `\p{L}` (neither matches
//! a supplementary-plane character). Case-insensitive patterns fold case with no locale, as the
//! container runs with no `LANG`: under en-US, `(?i)i` would also match `İ`.
//!
//! Every public function here was compared with the reference output on two generated corpora
//! of about 25,000 titles, credits and pairs each (all of song-identity-cases.json, plus mixed
//! scripts, marks, supplementary characters, brackets and separators), with no difference.
